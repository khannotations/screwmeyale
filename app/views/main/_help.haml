      See the

      page.
    %p.question Why aren't the pictures showing up?
    %p.answer Sometimes, the CAS login doesn't properly communicate with Yale's picture database. To solve this, try refreshing the page. If that doesn't work, simply log out and log back in.
    %p.question I accidentally made my roommate / suitemate / loved one Joe a lesbian! How can I change my screw's gender or sexual preferences if I made a mistake the first time?
    %p.answer For security purposes, you only get one chance to specify someone else's gender and sexual preferences. The only person who can change Joe's information is Joe himselfâ€”and he has the final say. If you made a mistake, get in touch with Joe, direct him to Screw Me Yale and tell him to update his preferences in the Profile panel.
