            %p{:style => "text-align: justify;"}
              You just accepted a request to screw 
              %b #{@from_screw.fullname} 
              with 
              %b #{@to_screw.fullname} 
              for 
              %b #{@short_event}!
            - if not @same_event
              %p{:style => "text-align: justify;"}
                Remember, your work isn't done quite yetâ€”
                %b #{@to_screw.nickname} is still unmatched for #{@to_event.gsub(/ 20\d\d/, "")}.
            %p{:style => "text-align: justify;"}
              The person you want to get in touch with is #{@from.fullname} (the person who was setting #{@from_screw.nickname} up) to make plans for the night of #{@short_event}. You can reach them at
              %a{:href=>"#{@from.email}"}#{@from.email},
              and they'll probably hit you up soon, too.
