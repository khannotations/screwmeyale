              Don't panic, this isn't anything (too) dirty--#{@screwer.nickname} is using Screw Me Yale to find the perfect date for you for #{@event}.
              Of course, we don't want people being screwed willy-nilly, so if you don't want #{@screwer.nickname} to set you up, or you're busy that day, you can stop #{obj}
