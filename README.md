# Screw Me Yale
### By [Rafi Khan](http://rafi.me)

This site is a matchmaking site for Yale Screws. All code was written by Rafi Khan, Yale 2015. 

Note: to run this on your own machine in development, you must create a file `config/credentials.yml`. Make it look like this:

    username: <cas username>
    password: <cas password>
    sendgrid_name: <sendgrid username>
    sendgrid_password: <sendgrid password>

See `config/environment.rb` for more info. Of course, the Sendgrid stuff is only if you want the mailer to work. Enjoy!
