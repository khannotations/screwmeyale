# Screw Me Yale
### By [Rafi Khan](http://rafikhan.me)

This site is a matchmaking site for Yale Screws. All code was written by Rafi Khan, Yale 2015. Please do not take any passwords, etc. that I've carelessly left on the open source code--I've made it open source so others in the Yale community can benefit from a novice programmer making his first web app.
